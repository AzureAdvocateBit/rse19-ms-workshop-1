# Introduction to Azure Pipelines

You can use Azure pipelines to test and build your Python (or any other language) projects without needing to set up any insfrastructure of your own. For this tutorial we will use the [Microsoft-hosted agents](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/hosted?view=azure-devops&WT.mc_id=rse19-github-taallard) with Python preinstalled - note that these can be Windows, Linux or macOS based.

## Setting things up

1. Head over to [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/?WT.mc_id=rse19-github-taallard)
